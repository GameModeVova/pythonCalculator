# All operations must respect these rools
# 1) if number has more than 10 whole number places it should be written in
# scientific notation. Max places after the dot in scientific notation == 4
# 1_123_130_000_0 == 1.1231+e7
# 2) Max decimal fractions before truncation == 10 
# 3) Max numbers can be displayied on the calculators display is 11 
# (so if the number is too big and wont fit (this could happen only if there will be too much 
# decimal fractions because otherwise it will be displayied in scientific notation), 
# its decimal part will be cutted and rounded)
